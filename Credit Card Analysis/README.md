# Credit Card Analysis using Power BI

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to analyze credit card data. The analysis provides insights into customer spending behavior, transaction patterns, and other key metrics by leveraging Power BI's powerful visualization tools.

## Introduction

The Credit Card Analysis project uses Power BI to visualize and analyze credit card transaction data. By connecting Power BI to a PostgreSQL database, we create interactive dashboards that offer valuable insights into credit card usage and customer behavior.

- Developed an interactive dashboard using transaction and customer data from a SQL database, to provide real-time insights.

- Streamlined data processing & analysis to monitor key performance metrics and trends.

- Shared actionable insights with stakeholders based on dashboard findings to support decision-making processes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two tables:

**Credit Card Table:** Contains transaction details including Client number, Card Category, Interest Earned,Transaction Amount and Credit Limit.

**Customer Table:** Contains customer details including Client Number,  age, gender, Education Level and other demographic information.
